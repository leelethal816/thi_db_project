# Texas Hunger Initiative Database Project

# In this project, our database team created a thorough database design and analysis for Texas Hunger Initiative which helps children in Texas to be fed in the summer. We have created ERD, data dictionary, SQL scripts for DDL and queries, and an analysis dashboard with Excel. This repository also includes the 2 project write-ups for documentation.
